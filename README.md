# ITHIM-R

Development of the ITHIM-R, also known as ITHIM version 3.0. Started in January 2018.

This document aims to be a comprehensive record of the calculations in the ITHIM pipeline, specifically the ITHIM- R package. Some details here are specific to the Accra version of that model, as Accra has been the setting for construction of the prototype.

### Outline
In this document, in general, lower-case letters correspond to indices, or dimensions, of objects, and take one of a set of possible values, detailed in Table 1.

The set of fixed input data items are denoted by capital letters, and variable parameters are denoted by greek letters. These are tabulated in Table 2.



### Data inputs
In general ITHIM-R requires `X number of` user defined inputs from various data sources. There are also numerous assumptions that you can parameterize in the model. 

#### Synthetic Population

##### Description: The first input you will need to provide is the synthetic population data. This data typically comes from a household travel survey or travel time use survey, and a self-report leisure time physical activity survey. These data will be uses throughout the process. A typical dataframe will include the following variables: 

#### Dataset format:

**We are currently working on developing a separate package to create a synthetic population**
