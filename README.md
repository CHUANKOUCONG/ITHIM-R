# ITHIM-R

Development of the ITHIM-R, also known as ITHIM version 3.0. Started in January 2018.

This document aims to be a comprehensive record of the calculations in the ITHIM pipeline, specifically the ITHIM- R package. Some details here are specific to the Accra version of that model, as Accra has been the setting for construction of the prototype.

### Outline
In this document, in general, lower-case letters correspond to indices, or dimensions, of objects, and take one of a set of possible values, detailed in Table 1 (Convert from LATEX).

The set of fixed input data items are denoted by capital letters, and variable parameters are denoted by greek letters. These are tabulated in Table 2 (Convert from LATEX).


### Data inputs
In general ITHIM-R requires `X number of` user defined inputs from various data sources. There are also numerous assumptions that you can parameterize in the model. 

#### Inputs
  * Synthetic Population
      * Travel survey
      * Leisure time and work physical activity
  * Who Hit Who Matrix
      * Police report data 
  * Air Pollution 
      * Background concentrations of PM2.5
      * Source apportionment of PM2.5 for vehicles
      * Country or City specific Vehicle Emissions Factors
      
#### Synthetic Population

**Description** 
The first input you will need to provide is the synthetic population data. This data typically comes from a household travel survey or travel time use survey, and a self-report leisure time physical activity survey. These data will be uses throughout the process. 

**Synthetic Population Dataset Format**
You should have a table with the following variables

* trip_id
* trip_mode
* trip_duration
* participant_id
* age
* sex
* age_cat
* ltpa_marg_met
* work_marg_met
