# ITHIM-R

Development of the ITHIM-R, also known as ITHIM version 3.0. Started in January 2018.

## 1. ITHIM in maths
This document aims to be a comprehensive record of the calculations in the ITHIM pipeline, specifically the ITHIM- R package. Some details here are specific to the Accra version of that model, as Accra has been the setting for construction of the prototype.

### 1.1 Outline
In this document, in general, lower-case letters correspond to indices, or dimensions, of objects, and take one of a set of possible values, detailed in Table 1.

The set of fixed input data items are denoted by capital letters, and variable parameters are denoted by greek letters. These are tabulated in Table 2.

The equations are given in Table 3. These use letter modifiers to show how the inputs are modified in the course of output generation. A description of the doseâ€“response relationship parametrisation is given in Section 3.

For further documentation consult the wiki. 
For ongoing discussions, see issues.
In addition, relevant documents are stored in shared GDrive folder, and a Slack channel is available for communications among contributors.
